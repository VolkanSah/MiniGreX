To add a comment to a post, you need to be logged in. Click on the "Log in" link at the top of the page to log in, or click on the "Register" link to create a new user account.

As an admin, you can also access the admin panel by clicking on the "Admin" link at the top of the page. From here, you can change the site title and description, as well as change the admin password.

## Security
MiniGreX-CMS has been designed with security in mind, and the code has been written to minimize the risk of SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. To ensure maximum security, we recommend keeping the CMS up-to-date with the latest security patches and using strong passwords for all user accounts.
